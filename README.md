# GeneticImageImitation

A genetic algorithm to approximate a given image with squares. 

This is created in the memory of Nick Berry, a similar algorithm was described in (one of his first blog posts)[http://datagenetics.com/blog/april2009/index.html]. I am not planning to imitate that post one-to-one, but in the spirit of learning new things from his writings by doing, I'll first try to build my own version based on what I remember of the most clever parts from the post. Once I'm done I'll go back and reread the whole thing to see how we matched.
