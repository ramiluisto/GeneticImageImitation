# GeneticImageImitation

A genetic algorithm to approximate a given image with squares. 


This is created in the memory of Nick Berry, a similar algorithm was described in [one of his first blog posts](http://datagenetics.com/blog/april2009/index.html). I am not planning to imitate that post one-to-one, but in the spirit of learning new things from his writings by doing, I'll first try to build my own version based on what I remember of the most clever parts from the post. Once I'm done I'll go back and reread the whole thing to see how we matched.


## Aims

- Build a system that does roughly what we want.
- Once it works, start improving on the performance based on where it is most needed.
- Write down what we did in a diary format.


## Current version: 0.5

- Many of the moving parts are in place.
- Too many magic numbers everywhere. When I know how the structure will look like in the end, I'll start cleaning these up.
- Inconsitent approaches to methods in similar classes.
- Insufficient testing
